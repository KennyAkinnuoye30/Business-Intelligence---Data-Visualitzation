## Land-based Wind Capacity Dashboard

**Purpose:** Analyze historical and current land-based wind capacity across the U.S., including build trends, state distribution, OEM dominance, and project-level details.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Multi-dimensional filtering (project status, year online, state, OEM, developer)
- Time-series analysis with cumulative capacity tracking
- Geographic distribution via interactive map
- OEM and turbine model breakdowns
